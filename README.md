## Your Challenge

Write a program, collaboratively, that prints each number from a user-provided range on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

### I will accept pull requests 10 minutes after they are made if nobody objects. If one of you objects to a change, feel free to explain why on the pull request's page before it is merged!
